## How it is played
Retro  Chess is a variant of traditional chess where captured pieces are fused to the capturing piece, giving it their movement and capturing capabilities. If another piece captures the fused piece, it gains the powers of the last piece that had capturing interaction. The king can also gain the powers of a captured piece, but still cannot move into positions where it may be captured. Pawns attached to other pieces may not promote unless certain conditions are met, and conflicting promotions will remove the lower-ranked piece. Capturing a piece of the same movement does not result in fusion.
